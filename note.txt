Nextjs is like react - run "npm run dev"

We need to create 2 fns connect and execute
Normal react would recognize window object but Nextjs wont so we need to do some workaround

    Make a button that will only exist if we are not connected so use useState
    const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);

    we can do let isConnected = false 
    Difference is useState help us to keep state between renders

    inside the request method in connect()
    setIsConnected(true); - we also use this connection to get a provider

    let connectedProvider = new ethers.provider.web3Provider(window.ethereum); 
    setSigner(connectedProvider.getSigner()); - using provider we get the signer 

    creating button for these functions
        <button onClick={() => connect()}>connect</button>
    
    To only show the button if you are connected
    {isConnected ? ("Connected!!") : (<button onClick={() => connect()}>connect</button>)}

Drawback is that when we switch pages we want the states to be saved like signer's etc and we dont want to clutter
everything with more code so we use other packages
